main.py is the only file needed for our final project. It is understood that at this current point, we were unable to get our project to be fully compiled for our desired output. We were hoping that it would output a final game board, along with the average time taken for each move from each player, however that was not achievable.

Nonetheless, by writing both Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning functions, we attempted to create a Go Game with two AI facing each other. The methods heuristic(), liberties(), is_territory_player_1(), is_territory_player_2(), and can_capture() are the methods which outline the rules of the Go-game.
